### OMDB-SEARCH
in this project, I am using a public API called OMBD API. it is an open movie database, very useful for making projects base on RESTful web service. I am using flask for serving the page, and use pure CSS, HTML, and pure javascript. why do we need to use an external library when the pure CSS and javascript can do the job? :)

i have deployed the project on heroku. if you wanna see, checkout here :

### How to use ? 
when you open the site. you will see a search input. you have to type the title of the movie that you want to search. then you click search button. you have to wait for a several second until the search result appear. while you are waiting, loading icon will be appeared. 
after the result of the movie appeared, you can see the detail of the movie after you click the detail button.
